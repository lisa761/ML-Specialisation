temperament for the appellate court we believe that a close examination of judge chatignys record in sentencing federal criminal defendants shows that he is appropriately sensitive to the facts of the person before him and the rights of victims of the crimes that have been committed indeed it is our understanding that the government has never filed an appeal from judge chatignys sentencings and that there has only been one defendant who has appealed from an upward departure we are of the strong opinion that judge chatignys record on the bench makes him an outstanding and very qualified candidate seventeen former federal prosecutors who have worked with judge chatigny wrote to the senate judiciary committee that in criminal as well as civil matters judge chatigny has proven himself over the course of 15 years on the bench to be unbiased compassionate and temperatein its 2006 dismissal of charges in the ross case the second circuit judicial council found that judge chatignys

he take forceful steps on rosss behalf while the judge used strong language there was no misconductin the judges reasonable view the circumstances thrust on him called for unusual action in discharge of judicial duty to ensure the fair resolution of the important proceeding before himchatigny has yet to rule on the appeal of former yale professor james van de velde who had sued the city of new

mcgraw born 1970 is an associate professor of marketing and psychology at the university of colorado at boulder his research spans the fields of judgment and decision making emotion affect and moodmcgraw is known for his early research on expectations and emotions in studying the emotional reactions of olympic athletes he finds that bronze medalists often appear happier with their accomplishment than silver medalists because silver medalists are more likely to have higher gold medal aspirations whereas bronze medalists are more likely to be the dark horse and exceed their expectationsmcgraw and jonathan levav have published work based on their theory of emotional accounting which is a complement to prior research on mental accounting emotional accounting posits that

of hedonic expendituresmcgraw also investigates what makes things funny his humor research was inspired in part by his research on moral violations with philip tetlock and mixed emotions with jeff

when a person simultaneously appraises a situation as wrong or unsettling some way ie a violation and yet appraises the situation to be okay or acceptable in some way ie benign his research is quickly moving the study of humor from the niche to mainstream psychology in 2014 mcgraw coauthored the humor code a book about the science of humor and his travels around the world with journalist joel

of 32 aaron is married to ruth with two sons dean and adambenzeev received his ba in philosophy and economics 1975 and his ma in philosophy 1977 both from the university of haifa he was awarded his phd from the university of chicago 1981 his doctoral thesis was entitled perception as a cognitive system his doctoral studies advisor was stephen toulmin alan gewirth robert richards and william wimsatt served on the doctoral committee michael strauss his ma thesis advisor and stephen toulmin have greatly influenced his philosophical views their thinking is marked by a unique combination of a broad outlook on the very profound issues of philosophy and life a careful analysis of the details and the ability to concretize their discussion in everyday issues despite such similarity they came from different backgrounds while strauss like his grandfather martin buber was submersed in the german tradition and his important writings are in german and hebrew toulmin a pupil of ludwig wittgenstein grew up within the english analytic traditionthe philosophers whose writings have made the greatest impact upon benzeev are aristotle baruch spinoza and immanuel kant kants main influence is most evident in ben zeevs discussions on epistemology and perception aristotles and spinozas impact is more apparent in his discussions of the mindbody problem and in his work on the emotionsbenzeevs major books are the perceptual system peter lang 1993 the subtlety of emotions mit up 2000 love online emotions on the internet cambridge up 2004 in the name of love romantic ideology and its victims with ruhama goussinsky oxford up 2008 die logik der gefhle kritik der emotionalen intelligenz suhrkamp 2009benzeev has held several academic positions at the university of haifa including president 20042012 rector 20002004 dean of research 19952000 philosophy department chairperson 19861988 chairperson of the humanity division oranimschool of education 19911994 chairperson of the association of university heads israel head of the university of haifa press and head of the academic channel he established the interdisciplinary center for the study of emotions at the university of haifa he is currently the president of the newly established european philosophical society for the study of emotionsphilosophical viewexplanatory toolsthe choice of conceptual tools determines the nature of our explanations in light of the complexity of psychological phenomena the tools that we use to explain them should be flexible enough to accommodate the complexity of reality three such tools which are evident throughout benzeevs writings are the distinctions between various levels of description prototypical and binary categories and intrinsically and extrinsically valuable activities the distinction between various levels of description reflects his stratification approach concerning the bodymind problem this approach has three basic assumptions a the mind consists of dispositional and actualized states and not of internal isolated entities b physiological and mental states are not actually separate but belong to two different levels of descriptionthe relationship between them is one of stratification rather than of causality and c mental and physical states emerge along a continuum that ranges from simple to more complex states this approach is close to aristotle spinoza and the advocates of the emergent view of mental properties this issue is discussed in detail in his book on perception benzeev further believes that prototypical categories which have no clearcut boundaries and no equal degree of membership are generally more appropriate to the psychological realm and hence clearcut definitions of emotions are of little value and general characterizations should be given preference furthermore we should expect many grey areas when discussing human activities benzeev emphasizes the importance of intrinsically valuable activities for longterm happiness and profound love the combination of all three distinctions is significant in explaining psychological and in particular emotional phenomena despite his use of complex conceptual tools on many issues benzeev remains close to a critical yet commonsense viewperceptionin his various writings on perception in particular the perceptual system benzeev rejects the indirect view of perception and argues for the presence of direct nonpure perception he rejects nave realism as well as extreme subjectivism and argues for a critical realism such realism considers perceptual qualities as properties of the perceptual environment which is a relational environment that presupposes the existence of a perceiver within the perceptual environment perception is direct as it involves direct awareness of events in the environment but in light of the relational nature of this environment perceptual awareness merely provides partial information about the worldthat part which is influenced by the subjects characteristics in his view perception is direct in two major senses it is perception of the objects themselves not of internal mental representations and it is not preceded by mediating inferential processes benzeevs book the perceptual system received an excellent review in the review of metaphysics with the reviewer jack ornstein stating that benzeevs view is the only remotely plausible approach to the mindbody problem finally we have a theory of perception and the mind which any scientificallyminded critical philosopher can live with together with his work on perception benzeev has pursued related issues in the philosophy of psychology such as the bodymind problem and memory and has written on various philosophers in particular aristotle and thomas reidemotionsfive years after finishing his phd thesis benzeev began to study the emotions a topic that remains at the center of his research today in this field he was particularly influenced by aristotle mainly his analysis of emotions as evaluative attitudes and by spinoza in particular his emphasis on the importance of change in generating emotions the psychological work that has most influenced his thinking has been the cognitive structure of emotions 1988 by ortony clore and collins benzeev has published many articles in this field as well as several books the subtlety of emotions mit 2000 love online emotions on the internet cambridge 2004 in the name of love romantic ideology and its victims oxford 2008 written with ruhama goussinsky and die logik der gefhle kritik der emotionalen intelligenz suhrkamp 2009the subtlety of emotions his major work on emotions is divided into two major parts the first presents an overall conceptual framework for understanding emotions and the second discusses individual emotions he considers emotion to be a general mode of the mental system and suggests that the typical cause of emotions is a perceived change the typical emotional concern is a comparative concern and the typical emotional object is a human being typical emotions are considered to have certain basic characteristicsinstability great intensity a partial perspective and relative brevityand four basic componentscognition evaluation motivation and feeling emotions are regarded as having a significant practical and moral valueromantic loveromantic love has been the major emotion discussed by benzeev in his book love online he demonstrates the value of his conceptual framework for understanding emotions on the internet and in particular romantic relationships in cyberspace no new emotion has been created on the internet but the generation of emotions is often differentfor example in the speed at which such emotions are generated he argues that the chaotic and dynamic nature of cyberspace will not replace the more stable nature of actualspace as we cannot live in complete chaos the test of the internet will be whether it can complement ordinary romantic activities just as the telephone complements ordinary social activities or whether it will merely replace them with less valuable activities as the television frequently doesthe book in the name of love is about our ideals of love as expressed in the romantic ideology our experiences of love and the disparity between the two this ideology which assumes that love is comprehensive uncompromising and unconditional may lead to extreme behavior such as is found in men who murder their wives or partners allegedly out of love although romantic ideology may have a negative impact on many people in different circumstances it still has the positive function of a guiding ideal at the basis of ben zeevs proposed nurturing approach lies the assumption that in order for romantic love to be maintained the lover should not merely ensure that the beloved feels good it is imperative too that the lover is profoundly satisfied with the way in which the relationship enhances her own development and flourishing only a profoundly satisfied person can enhance the flourishing of the other and of their togetherness in many current societies love is on the mind of an evergreater number of people and its presence is a major criterion for relationships love can no longer be dismissed as a silly fantasy it is perceived as realistic and feasible for an increasing number of peoplein recent years benzeevs research has been focused on romantic compromises and related issues such as the profundity of love the relationship between love and sex and love and time in romantic compromises people relinquish a romantic value such as romantic freedom or intense sexual desire in exchange for a nonromantic value like the wish to live comfortably he considers such compromises to be the most common and painful syndrome in intimate relationships nevertheless he argues for the existence of good romantic compromises where there is a value convergence between the two lovers and the lovers minds are at rest as their togetherness has an intrinsic value', 'aaron bertram born april 3 1981 in lubbock texas is a trumpet player for third wave ska band suburban legends and member of
